# IPFS Weekly #5

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

Here are some of the highlights for the [February 1](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/88) sprint:

## Updates

* [**go-ipfs**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) 
  - [@noffle](//github.com/noffle) made [a fix](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2296) for when your FUSE connection is terminated.  
  - [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) made a lot of documentation fixes to the CLI while working on the IPFS HTTP API.
  - [@lgierth](//github.com/lgierth) improved the automated [docker image](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2308) for go-ipfs, which is now named `ipfs/go-ipfs`. Give it a try: `docker run -i --net=host ipfs/go-ipfs`. The new image is built automatically for every commit, and has automatic tags for the coming releases. It's also a few MB smaller, and doesn't require mounting a volume for the IPFS repository anymore. Instead, if there's no volume mounted, it'll generate an ephemeral identity and configuration which will be lost when the container exits. This is ideal for testing or just trying something out real quick. Images for go-ipfs 0.3.x are not provided, because the Dockerfile shipped with these version isn't suitable for Docker Hub automatic builds.
* [**distributions**](//github.com/ipfs/distributions)
	- [dist.ipfs.io](http://dist.ipfs.io/) _almost_ has [signed releases](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions/pull/51) thanks to [@dignifiedquire](//github.com/dignifiedquire). THis will be coming soon.
	- [@noffle](//github.com/noffle) [worked](https://github.com/ipfs/distributions/pull/42) to get [ipget](http://ipget.me/) ready to be on [dist.ipfs.io](http://dist.ipfs.io/)
* [**gx**](//github.com/whyrusleeping) 
	- [@whyrusleeping](//github.com/whyrusleeping) shipped the GX PR, which pulls relevant code out of go-ipfs and into the new GX package manager. He also wrote a tool to publish IPNS records without the IPFS daemon.
	- [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) spruced up the [gx README](https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx) - it is almost ready to ship. 
* [**js-ipfs**](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) 
	- Thanks to @diasdavid, `object features` now works, with tests and all. 
	- As well, thanks to [@dignifiedquire](//github.com/dignifiedquire)'s efforts, the js-ipfs API now returns promises if there isn't a specified callback, allowing both major methods used by the Javascript community to work equally well.
* [**registry-mirror**](//github.com/diasdavid/registry-mirror) 
	- [@diasdavid](//github.com/diasdavid) merged registry-static into registry-mirror and removed all of the unnecessary stuff [(this was huge)](https://github.com/diasdavid/registry-mirror/pull/33).

## Work in Progress

* **Logo**: [@Kubuxu](//github.com/Kubuxu) worked on a new [IPFS logo](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTgtbb4LckHaXh1YhpNcBu48cFY8zgT1Lh49q7q7ksf3M/). Check it out.

## Community

* **Conferences**: If you have any suggestions, there is a [new issue](https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/105) where you can submit your proposals. The IPFS community will see if we can get to that conference and have a presence there.
